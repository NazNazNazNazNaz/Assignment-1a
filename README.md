# Assignment-1a

My plan is to take one of python programs that I used for a big assignment in my previous class.

The program was a menu that contained three different tools you could choose from including a calculator, a currency converter, and a random number generator.

I will be creating a menu containing a simple calculator and random number generator (given user inputs of a range) and converting the code into Java under the specifications of the later assignment. 
The Python assignment had me create these with a GUI and as I'm not familiar with how to create a one in Java, I may opt to instead have a more simple text-based program that uses a main loop to run these. 
However I might still create a new GUI for this program since this could be an opportunity to learn the process of it.
